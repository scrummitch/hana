# Hana PHP Framework

[Kohana](http://Hanaframework.org/) is an elegant, open source, and object oriented HMVC framework built using PHP5, by a team of volunteers. It aims to be swift, secure, and small.

[Hana](https://github.com/scrummitch/hana) is a derivative of Kohana, sorry if you dont like it but i kind of do.

Released under a [BSD license](http://Kohanaframework.org/license), Hana can be used legally for any open source, commercial, or personal project.

## Documentation
Kohana's documentation can be found at <http://Kohanaframework.org/documentation> which also contains an API browser.

The `userguide` module included in all Kohana releases also allows you to view the documentation locally. Once the `userguide` module is enabled in the bootstrap, it is accessible from your site via `/index.php/guide` (or just `/guide` if you are rewriting your URLs).
